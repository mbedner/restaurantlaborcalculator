You are a senior full-stack engineer. Build a production-ready, single-page “Restaurant Labor Cost Calculator” website.

Tech stack:
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployed as a static-friendly site (works with Vercel)
- Everything on ONE page route: / (no login, no database)

Goal:
A fast, mobile-friendly calculator that computes restaurant labor cost % and gives benchmarking guidance by restaurant type.

Core inputs (UI):
1) Time period selector: Weekly / Monthly / Yearly (default Monthly)
2) Restaurant type selector: Quick Service / Casual Dining / Fine Dining
3) Total Revenue for the period (number input, USD)
4) Total Labor Cost for the period (number input, USD)
   - Labor cost includes wages, salaries, overtime, payroll taxes, benefits, bonuses, PTO (show as tooltip or helper text)

Optional “advanced inputs” accordion (collapsed by default):
- Hourly wages total (USD)
- Salaried wages total (USD)
- Overtime total (USD)
- Payroll taxes total (USD)
- Benefits total (USD)
- Bonuses total (USD)
- PTO total (USD)

Behavior:
- If advanced inputs are used, auto-sum them into “Total Labor Cost” (and show the sum).
- Allow user to either enter Total Labor Cost directly OR expand advanced and itemize. If itemized is used, Total Labor Cost field becomes read-only and displays the sum.
- Real-time calculation after input changes.
- Include a “Reset” button.
- Include a “Share” feature that encodes inputs in the URL query params so users can copy/paste link and preserve state.

Calculations:
- Labor Cost % = (Total Labor Cost / Total Revenue) * 100
- Handle divide-by-zero and invalid inputs gracefully.
- Round displayed percent to 1 decimal (e.g., 29.7%).
- Display currency with commas and $.

Benchmark ranges (use these constants):
- Quick Service: 20%–25%
- Casual Dining: 25%–30%
- Fine Dining: 30%–35%
General guidance:
- “Under 30% is often a healthy target, but varies by concept and location.”

Outputs (results card):
- Labor Cost % (big number)
- Status badge based on selected restaurant type:
  - “Below typical range” if below range
  - “Within typical range” if in range
  - “Above typical range” if above range
- Show the typical range for the selected type
- Show “What this means” bullets:
  - If above range: suggest optimizing scheduling, cross-training, forecasting, prep efficiency (do NOT advise layoffs/cutting staff as the primary approach)
  - If below range: note it may reflect efficiency, but also watch service quality and burnout
  - If within range: reinforce and suggest monitoring by daypart and sales volume

Extra mini-metrics (nice-to-have):
- Labor dollars per $1,000 revenue
- If period is weekly/monthly/yearly, show implied annualized revenue/labor cost for context (annualized = monthly*12, weekly*52, yearly*1)

SEO + content requirements (same page):
- Title tag: “Restaurant Labor Cost Calculator (Labor % & Benchmarks)”
- H1: “Restaurant Labor Cost Calculator”
- Intro paragraph (2–3 sentences) describing formula and what’s included.
- Add an FAQ section (accordion) with 6–8 FAQs:
  - What is restaurant labor cost percentage?
  - What costs are included in labor cost?
  - What is a good labor cost percentage?
  - How often should I calculate labor cost?
  - Why is my labor cost percentage high?
  - How can I reduce labor cost without hurting service?
- Implement JSON-LD structured data for FAQPage.

UX requirements:
- Clean, modern, minimal
- Mobile-first
- Form validation messages inline (don’t use alerts)
- Accessible labels, keyboard navigation, and ARIA where needed

Code requirements:
- Provide complete code files.
- Include a README with local run instructions.
- No external paid APIs.
- Keep dependencies minimal.

Deliverables:
- Next.js project code with the working calculator on the home page.
- Provide clear comments explaining calculation logic and benchmark logic.
