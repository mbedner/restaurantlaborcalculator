      "name": "What is restaurant labor cost percentage?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Restaurant labor cost percentage shows how much of your revenue goes toward labor expenses. It’s calculated by dividing total labor cost by total revenue, then multiplying by 100."
      }

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What costs are included in labor cost?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Labor cost typically includes hourly wages, salaried pay, overtime, payroll taxes, employee benefits, bonuses, and paid time off. Any expense directly tied to staffing should be counted."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a good labor cost percentage for a restaurant?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It depends on your restaurant type. Quick service restaurants often target 20–25%, casual dining 25–30%, and fine dining 30–35%. There’s no single “perfect” number—context matters."
      }

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How often should I calculate labor cost?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many operators track labor cost weekly for scheduling decisions and monthly for financial reporting. Regular monitoring helps catch issues early before they impact profitability."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why is my labor cost percentage high?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "High labor cost is often caused by mismatched scheduling, slow sales periods, inefficient workflows, or limited cross-training—not just overstaffing. Improving efficiency usually has more impact than cutting hours."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I reduce labor cost without hurting service?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Focus on smarter scheduling, better sales forecasting, cross-training staff, and operational efficiency. Reducing labor purely by cutting staff often leads to poor service and higher turnover."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does higher labor cost always mean my restaurant is unprofitable?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Labor cost should be evaluated alongside revenue growth, guest experience, and staff retention. Some concepts require higher labor investment to deliver quality service."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is labor cost the same as payroll?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Payroll is part of labor cost, but labor cost also includes taxes, benefits, bonuses, and paid time off. Payroll alone doesn’t tell the full picture."
